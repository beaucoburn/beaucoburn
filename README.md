    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> specializing in <strong>React</strong>. I enjoy hiking, snorkeling and movies. I really have done a lot of different things in my life. A long time ago, I worked as a sound engineer because I like mixing music for bands and at the same time, I also worked in a production company as a video editor, producer and a grip. Later, I was a restaurant general manager. I liked taking care of people and I liked running a business but I wasn't so passionate about the restaurant business itself. I later moved to Mexico and became an english teacher but I always missed doing technical and creative things from my time before. When I thought about that and thought what could I do to scratch that same itch, I thought maybe I should get into <strong>software development</strong> and so here I am.</p>
    <p>I am so passionate about learning new things. <strong>Software development</strong> has been challenging but it's great that I can kind of make things with my hands. While I have been focused on React, I've started to branch out this year. At the beginning of the year I was learning <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>. Later, I started to dive into <strong>Java</strong>. Now, I'm focused on <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>React Native</strong>. <strong>React Native</strong> feels familiar and very comfortable. <strong>Golang</strong> to me has been great. I'm still learning <strong>Golang</strong> but so far I like the relative simplicity combined with the performance. Where will all of this take me in the future? I'm not sure but I guess we'll see.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ My Languages</h2>
    <p>As a Frontend Developer, of course I'm focused on HTML, CSS, Typescript and ReactJS.  Lately, I've been focusing on other areas to expand my knowledge in Go and React Native.</p>

    <h2>📚📖 My Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
    <p>In the beginning we could get by with just the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but now our world in frameworks and libraries.  I'm primarily a React Developer and lately I've been using a lot of NextJS.  Of course like everyone, I've used a lot of Bootstrap, but I've also used Chakra and now I'm starting to use Shadcn.  In this current chapter, I am starting to think even more about the backend and also deeper Computer Science.  Always on the journey and hopefully always growing.</p>
