- 👋 Hi, I’m @beaucoburn
- 👀 I’m of course focused on Software Development in general. While I've spent some time focused on React, NextJS and Tailwind specifically, I really want to build the skills to be more competent as fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on Python and SQL.
- 📫 hello@beaucoburn.com
