    <h2>My Languages</h2>
    <p>As a Frontend Developer, of course I'm focused on HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Lately, I've been trying to learn other things too, like Python, SQL and Typescript</p>

    <h2>My Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
    <p>In the beginning we could get by with just the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but now our world in frameworks and libraries.  I'm primarily a React Developer and lately I've been using a lot of NextJS.  Of course like everyone, I've used a lot of Bootstrap, but I've also used Chakra and now I'm starting to use Shadcn.  I've also of course experimented with some Django as well.</p>
