    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Frontend Developer specializing in React. I enjoy hiking, snorkeling and movies. I really have done a lot of different things in my life. A long time ago, I worked as a sound engineer because I like mixing music for bands and at the same time, I also worked in a production company as a video editor, producer and a grip. Later, I was a restaurant general manager. I liked taking care of people and I liked running a business but I wasn't so passionate about the restaurant business itself. I later moved to Mexico and became an english teacher but I always missed doing technical and creative things from my time before. When I thought about that and thought what could I do to scratch that same itch, I thought maybe I should get into software development and so here I am.</p>
    <p>I am so passionate about learning new things. Software development has been challenging but it's great that I can kind of make things with my hands. While I have been focused on React, I've started to branch out this year. At the beginning of the year I was learning Python and Django. Later, I started to dive into Java. Now, I'm focused on Go and React Native. React Native feels familiar and very comfortable. Golang to me has been great. I'm still learning Golang but so far I like the relative simplicity combined with the performance. Where will all of this take me in the future? I'm not sure but I guess we'll see.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ My Languages</h2>
    <p>As a Frontend Developer, of course I'm focused on HTML, CSS, Typescript and ReactJS.  Lately, I've been focusing on other areas to expand my knowledge in Go and React Native.</p>

    <h2>📚📖 My Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
    <p>In the beginning we could get by with just the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but now our world in frameworks and libraries.  I'm primarily a React Developer and lately I've been using a lot of NextJS.  Of course like everyone, I've used a lot of Bootstrap, but I've also used Chakra and now I'm starting to use Shadcn.  In this current chapter, I am starting to think even more about the backend and also deeper Computer Science.  Always on the journey and hopefully always growing.</p>
