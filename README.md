- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @beaucoburn
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m of course focused on Software Development in general. While I've spent some time focused on React, NextJS and Tailwind specifically, I really want to build the skills to be more competent as fullstack developer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on Python and SQL.
